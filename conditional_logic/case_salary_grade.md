# CASE Expression: Categorizing Employees by Salary Grade

The `CASE` expression in Oracle SQL allows us to evaluate multiple conditions and return a value based on the first true match.

### Scenario:
HR wants to **categorize employees** into salary grades:
- **A - Executive**: Salary â‰¥ 20,000
- **B - Manager**: Salary between 10,000 and 19,999
- **C - Associate**: Salary between 5,000 and 9,999
- **D - Entry Level**: Salary < 5,000

### Query Example:
```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    last_name,
    salary,
    CASE 
        WHEN salary >= 20000 THEN 'A - Executive'
        WHEN salary BETWEEN 10000 AND 19999 THEN 'B - Manager'
        WHEN salary BETWEEN 5000 AND 9999 THEN 'C - Associate'
        ELSE 'D - Entry Level'
    END AS salary_grade
FROM 
    employees;

Why Use CASE?

It's versatile: You can check for ranges, values, or complex expressions.

Helps you customize output without altering the underlying data.

Makes queries more readable when dealing with business logic.

ðŸ“Œ Use CASE instead of DECODE when your logic requires evaluating ranges, conditions, or complex rules.
